Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts, applications
that run exactly as programmed without possibility of downtime, censorship,
fraud or third party interference. The go-ethereum project comes with:

geth:
   main Ethereum CLI client. It is the entry point into the Ethereum network
   (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default),
   archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving
   data live)
