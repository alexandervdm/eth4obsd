Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts, applications
that run exactly as programmed without possibility of downtime, censorship,
fraud or third party interference.

This package contains the geth client, one of the original implementations
of the Ethereum protocol. It is the entry point into the Ethereum network,
capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all
historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live).
