Running Geth on OpenBSD
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, the _geth user and its processes run in the login(1) class
of "daemon". The standard limits defined in login.conf(5) for this class
are insufficient to run geth. Instead you should define a new login
class for geth to allow appropriate resources.

For example, add this to your login.conf(5) file:

	geth:\
		:openfiles-max=131072:\
		:openfiles-cur=65536:\
		:tc=daemon:

And change the login class for the _geth user as follows:

	usermod -L geth _geth
	
You will also want to raise the global limit for the maximum number 
of open files in the system through the sysctl(2) value:

	sysctl kern.maxfiles=262144

Starting Geth on OpenBSD

The daemon can be enabled/started using regular rcctl(8) commands.

Note that while the configuration file that was installed at /etc/geth.conf
contains a functional/complete set of options to connect to the mainnet,
not all options are currently allowed to be configured in this way.
